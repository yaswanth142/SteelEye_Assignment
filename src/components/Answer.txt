### 1)Explain what the simple List component does.
### 2)What problems / warnings are there with code?
### 3)Please fix, optimize, and/or modify the component as much as you think is necessary.

### Answer 

### LISTS:

->Lists are used to display data in an ordered format and mainly used to display menus on websites. 
->In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript. 

### List Compounent and Example:

->In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript.
-> Let us see how we transform Lists in regular JavaScript. 
->The map() function is used for traversing the lists. 
->In the below example, the map() function takes an array of numbers and multiply their values with 5.

### Errors in Code:

### Step1:

### Error1:

  onClick={()=>onClickHandler(index)}

  OnClick is an functional Component ,so we can used the {()=>} Arrow Function

### Error2:

   index: PropTypes.number
In this ,We are not added the index ,Index is used to taken the parent component and indentify the unique value and varables.
Maping the indexes,we use the index on return function

### Error3:

  const [setSelectedIndex, SelectedIndex] = useState();

  ->In the above code having error ,Because the error is in the the position of the data and setdata are interchanged so, 
  ->we have to retify the error in the useState hook

  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState();

### Error4:
   
   Use the arrayof instead of array and Shape instead of shapeof in the WrappedListComponent.propTypes 

### Error5:
  
    We have to pass the data using props 

WrappedListComponent.defaultProps = {
  items: null,
};

After Retifying Error,

WrappedListComponent.defaultProps = {
  items: [{text:"yeswanth",index:1}],
};
